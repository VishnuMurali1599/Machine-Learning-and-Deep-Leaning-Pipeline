Explanation of Key Components and Their Functions
1. data/
raw/: Stores the raw dataset that will be preprocessed.
processed/: Cleaned and transformed data, ready for model training.
external/: Data fetched from external APIs or sources.
augmented/: If you're working with images or sequences, this folder will contain augmented data.
validation/: Holds a validation dataset for model evaluation during training.

2. notebooks/
01_eda_notebook.ipynb: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset (distributions, visualizations).
02_model_experiment.ipynb: Experiment with different ANN architectures.
03_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb: Use techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomSearch for hyperparameter optimization.
04_metrics_analysis.ipynb: Analyze different model metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
05_results_visualization.ipynb: Visualize results such as training curves, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.

3. src/
config/:
config.py: Central configuration file (paths, global settings).
model_config.yaml: Stores architecture-related hyperparameters such as number of layers, units per layer, activation functions.
ui_config.yaml: Stores settings related to the UI, such as chart types, graphs to display.
data_preprocessing/:
data_loader.py: Handles loading raw data, splitting into train/test sets, and preprocessing (scaling, encoding).
feature_engineering.py: Code for extracting or transforming features.
model/:
ann_model.py: Defines the architecture of the ANN model.
model_train.py: Code for training the ANN, including data loading, callbacks (early stopping, checkpoints), and logging.
model_eval.py: Code to evaluate the model using various metrics and visualizations.
deployment/:
api.py: Exposes the trained model through a REST API (Flask/FastAPI).
inference.py: Handles model inference logic (making predictions on new data).
model_server.py: Manages API requests for batch predictions or single requests.
ui/: The user interface folder where the UI is built (using Flask/Django).
app.py: Runs the app server that integrates with the model API and serves the UI.
templates/: HTML templates for displaying UI (results, charts, model predictions).
static/: Stores static files like CSS, JavaScript for the UI.

4. logs/
Store training logs (loss/accuracy), inference logs (model requests), and system logs (errors, system health).
results/: Store results such as evaluation metrics and model performance reports.

5. models/
model_v1.h5: Versioned saved models.
metadata/: Metadata of saved models, such as training configurations, hyperparameters, and evaluation results.

6. automation/
Python and shell scripts for automating training, retraining, deployment, and UI deployment.

7. docker/
Docker-related files for containerizing both the model and the UI application for easy deployment.

8. UI (User Interface):
Use Flask or Django to create a UI to allow users to input data and visualize predictions.
Display model results, metrics, and visualizations of the model's performance.
