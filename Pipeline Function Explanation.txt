Key Components Explained:
Data Directory:

Raw: Stores the raw unprocessed data as obtained from external sources.
Processed: Cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed data ready for training.
External: Datasets from external sources, which may include external pre-trained models.
Augmented: Stores augmented data generated through techniques like rotation, scaling, or other transformations.
Splits: Contains the data splits (training, validation, and test sets) to ensure correct evaluation and generalization.
Notebooks:

Data Exploration: Jupyter notebook to explore the dataset, visualize correlations, and understand data distribution.
Feature Engineering: Notebook dedicated to creating meaningful features from raw data.
Model Architecture Design: Experimentation with different ANN architectures suitable for multi-output regression (e.g., using multiple neurons for each output in the output layer).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Focused on hyperparameter optimization, such as learning rate, batch size, optimizer choice, and model architecture settings.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance on the validation and test datasets, focusing on metrics such as R^2, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Source Code:

Data Preprocessing: Functions to clean and preprocess the data (e.g., normalization, handling missing values).
Feature Engineering: Scripts for generating new features or selecting the most impactful ones.
Model Architecture: Defines the ANN structure for multi-output regression. This includes specifying the output layer with multiple nodes, each corresponding to a different target variable.
Training: Implements the training process (model fitting), including the choice of loss function (e.g., mean squared error) and optimization algorithm.
Evaluation: Scripts to evaluate the model using multiple metrics, considering each output separately or as a combined metric.
Incremental Training: Handles incremental or online learning, updating the model without retraining from scratch when new data arrives.
